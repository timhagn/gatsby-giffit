## Description

<!-- Provide as much useful information as you can about the issue that you're seeing. -->

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
    Clear steps describing how to reproduce the issue. 
    Please link to a demo project if possible, this makes your issue _much_ easier 
    to diagnose (seriously). Perhaps just clone https://github.com/timhagn/gbitest
    and try to replicate your issue there?

### Expected result

<!-- What should happen? -->

### Actual result

<!-- What happened. -->

### Environment

<!--
  Required. Run `gatsby info --clipboard` in your gatsby project directory and 
  paste its contents here. Should your CLI of choice not support copying directly 
  to clipboard, just copy & paste `gatsby info`'s output here - both ways
  enclosing it within a code block (tripple backticks / ```) would be great!
