<!--
  To make it easier for me to help you, please include as much useful information as possible.
  Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues https://github.com/timhagn/gatsby-giffit/issues
  
  And though I try to include new features right away, be aware, that not every
  one of them can be added to `gatsby-giffit`. 
-->

## Summary

<!-- Brief explanation of the feature. -->

### Basic example

<!--
    If the proposal involves new or changed handling, include a basic code example.
    Perhaps just clone https://github.com/timhagn/gbitest and try to include it there?
    Omit this section if it's not applicable.

### Motivation

<!-- Why should this be supported? What is the expected outcome? -->
