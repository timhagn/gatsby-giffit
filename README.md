`gatsby-plugin-giffit` & `gatsby-transformer-giffit` are a Gatsby plugin and 
transformer which for (animated) GIFs (**_shall soon_**) provide, what Gatsby's 
own `gatsby-plugin-sharp` & `gatsby-transformer-sharp`do for the rest of 
your images.  

Optimized sizes and conversion to WebP for browsers that support it as well as
a single extracted Base64 encoded GIF-animation frame as a preview during load
are already (mostly) working.
