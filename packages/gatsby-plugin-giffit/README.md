# gatsby-plugin-giffit

This plugin processes provided GIFs and returns a fixed / fluid structure like 
`gatsby-plugin-sharp`.

Optimized sizes and conversion to WebP for browsers that support it as well as
a single extracted Base64 encoded GIF-animation frame as a preview during load
are already (mostly) working. 

Any help would be wholeheartedly appreciated : )!
